# VSCodium Portable

VSCodium is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications with binary releases of VS Code without MS branding/telemetry/licensing.


VSCodium Portable is a build of the Visual Studio Code editor without MS 
telemetry/tracking and Open Source. It's packaged with a PortableApps.com 
launcher as a portable app, so you can use it from a cloud folder, portable
drive, or local folder without needing to install it on each PC. It has all
the same features as Visual Studio Code, plus, it leaves no personal information
behind on the machine you run it on, so you can take it with you wherever you go.
